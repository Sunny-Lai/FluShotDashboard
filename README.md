# Flu Shot Dashboard
## Objective
In this project, I analyzed a healthcare database to assist a physician in determining how many active patients need a flu shot within our healthcare system. I utilized SQL to join three related data tables and extracted the joined dataset to Tableau where I stratified by demographic information. Tableau was utilizied to create a dashboard and published to tableau public found here: [Flu Shots Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/ImmunizationDashboard_17032863888990/HealthcareSystemFluShots2022?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
